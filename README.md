# Doctoral researcher in Computational Neuroscience
Currently pursuing a PhD in decoding speech from ECoG brain recorded neural data

## Work Experience
- PhD (2021-2024):
  Goal : Speech decoding from ECoG neural activity.
  The decoding method utilize two flows:
    an encoder decoder architecture where we employ a Vision Transformer architecture at the encoding stage
    a CLIP model deployed to train the encoder simultaneously with the encoder decoder training
  Results: We succeeded in synthesizing intelligible vowels
  
- Research assistant (2020):
  Development of a real-time speech synthesizer based on the first two formants acoustic features within a GUI software.
- Engineering graduation Project (2019):
  Development of a Natural Language Understaing algorithm transforming speech commands into control sentences to control a connected kitchen.
  Speech is first transformed into a text transcript using an ASR, then processed into a tree highlighting its linguistic and semantic dependecies utilizing a Dependency Parsing Tree algorithm.
